# Privacy Policy for Pixel Pulse

**Last Updated:** September 22, 2025

Welcome to Pixel Pulse! This Privacy Policy explains how **fertwbr** ("we," "us," or "our") handles information when you use our Pixel Pulse mobile application (the "Service").

## 1. Information We Process

Our commitment is to your privacy. The Service is designed to function almost entirely on your device.

**a) Audio Data (Microphone Access):**
*   **Purpose:** The core functionality of the Service requires access to your device's microphone to measure the ambient sound pressure level (decibels).
*   **Processing:** This audio data is processed **in real-time, entirely locally on your device**. The raw audio is immediately discarded after the decibel level is calculated. **We do not store, record, or transmit your raw audio off your device.**
*   **Collection Trigger:** Microphone access is only active when you are using the app and have explicitly granted microphone permission.

**b) Session Data (Stored Locally):**
*   **Purpose:** If you choose to use the "Save Session" feature, the calculated results of your measurement are stored on your device.
*   **Data Stored:** This data includes the start time, duration, min/avg/max decibel values, and a list of the calculated decibel readings over time.
*   **Storage:** This session data is stored in a **private, local database on your device only**. It is **not** transmitted to us or any third party. You have full control to delete this data at any time from within the app's "History" screen.

**c) In-App Purchase Information (Pixel Pulse+):**
*   **Purpose:** To unlock premium features through a **one-time purchase**.
*   **Data Processed by Google Play:** All purchase transactions are processed directly by **Google Play's billing system**. We do **not** collect or store your payment information (like credit card details). We only receive a confirmation token from Google Play that verifies your entitlement status. This status is stored locally on your device.

## 2. Information Sharing and Disclosure

We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information or session data. Since all core data is processed and stored locally, there is no data to share with outside parties.

## 3. Data Security, Retention, and Deletion

*   **Security:** All your session data is protected by the standard security measures of the Android operating system, as it resides within the app's private storage.
*   **Retention:** Data is retained on your device only as long as you keep the saved sessions or the app is installed.
*   **Deletion:** You can delete any or all of your saved sessions at any time through the "History" screen in the app. Clearing the app's data or uninstalling the application will also permanently delete all stored session data.

## 4. Children's Privacy

The Service is not intended for anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children.

## 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.
