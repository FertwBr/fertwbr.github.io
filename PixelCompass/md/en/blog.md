Welcome to the official Pixel Compass blog! This is the place for feature announcements, deep dives into app functionality, pro tips, and news about what's next.

## Announcing Version 1.6.0: The Level Up Update
*Posted: August 10, 2025*

We are thrilled to announce the release of Pixel Compass v1.6.0, our most ambitious update yet! This version focuses on elevating your experience across all your devices, with a completely redesigned Level screen, full support for large screens like tablets and foldables, and a more intuitive and powerful settings architecture.

### A Truly Adaptive Experience
Pixel Compass now intelligently adapts its layout to your device. On tablets or when your phone is in landscape mode, a `NavigationRail` appears for comfortable one-handed use, and screens like Compass and Settings reorganize into multi-pane layouts. This makes better use of your screen real estate and provides a truly premium experience.

### A Level Tool You'll Love to Use
We've rebuilt the Level tool from the ground up with expressive Material 3 animations. Whether your phone is flat on a surface or held upright, the UI morphs and reacts with fluid, physics-based animations, giving you a more precise and delightful tool for any task.

### A Smarter, More Organized Hub
The Settings screen has been restructured into a clean "hub-and-spoke" model. Find what you need faster with dedicated sub-screens for Display, Compass, and Dynamic Cards. We've also introduced master switches to give you broader control over your preferences with a single tap.

This update represents a major leap forward in our mission to create the best navigation tool for Android. We can't wait for you to try it!


## Pro Tips: How Calibration Ensures Your Compass Accuracy  

*Posted: July 17, 2025*  

Your compass isn’t just a pretty dial — it’s a precision instrument that relies on your device’s sensors. But did you know those sensors can drift over time? That’s where calibration comes in.  

### Why Calibration Matters  

All modern smartphones and smartwatches use magnetometers — tiny sensors that detect magnetic fields. However, these sensors can be affected by nearby electronics, metal, and even temperature changes.  

A quick calibration helps your compass correct any sensor bias, ensuring you always get accurate headings. On Pixel Compass, this means your North is really North.  

### When Should You Calibrate?  

- After installing a system update  
- After traveling long distances  
- If your readings seem off  
- When switching between devices or accessories (like magnetic cases)  

### How to Calibrate with Pixel Compass  

- On **Phone**: Open settings, tap **Compass Calibration**, and follow the on-screen steps.  
- On **Wear OS**: Open the app settings on your watch and tap **Calibrate Compass**.  

Our animation will guide you through the process — it takes less than a minute!  

### Pro Tip: The "Figure-8" Move  

When prompted, move your device in a slow figure-eight motion. This realigns the sensors and clears magnetic distortions.

## Introducing Pixel Compass for Wear OS!

*Posted: July 15, 2025*

We are thrilled to announce the biggest update to Pixel Compass yet: a completely redesigned, standalone experience for your Wear OS watch!

With the release of **version 1.5.0**, we’ve brought the same focus on design, precision, and performance that you love on your phone directly to your wrist. This isn't just a phone companion app; it's a fully independent navigation tool that uses your watch's own sensors and GPS to guide you.

### What’s New on Your Wrist?

We didn't just shrink the app; we reimagined it for the watch. The iconic star-shaped compass rose has been perfectly adapted for round displays, providing essential data like altitude, incline, and your precise coordinates at a single glance.

The animations have been completely re-engineered to be incredibly fluid and responsive, making it feel like you have a high-quality physical instrument on your wrist. And with support for Material You's dynamic theming on Wear OS 4+, the app’s colors will automatically adapt to your chosen watch face for a seamless, personalized look.

This has been a major architectural undertaking, and we're incredibly proud of the result. We believe this makes Pixel Compass the most beautiful and functional compass available for Wear OS.
