# Pixel Compass - Help & Frequently Asked Questions

Welcome to the Pixel Compass Help & FAQ page! Our goal is to help you navigate your world with precision and style — and make the most of your experience.

## Getting Started

### 1. What permissions does Pixel Compass need and why?
Pixel Compass requires **Precise Location** permission to enable its best features:
-   **True North Accuracy:** To calculate the local magnetic declination for a precise geographic North reading.
-   **Weather & Environmental Data:** To fetch local weather, your location's name, and elevation data for the Dynamic Info Cards.
-   **Pixel Compass+ Widgets:** Location is required for the widgets to update with accurate, relevant data in the background.

> Your location is only used when the app is active or for periodic widget updates. We never store or track your location history. You can manage permissions at any time in your device settings.

### 2. Understanding the Main Compass Screen
-   **Compass Dial:** The main rotating element. The top of your device always indicates your heading.
-   **Azimuth & Cardinal Direction:** The large number is your heading in degrees, and the text below (e.g., "NW") is the cardinal direction.
-   **Circular Info Ring:** Displays your Latitude, Longitude, Altitude, and the device's Incline at a glance.
-   **Dynamic Info Cards:** (Optional, enable in Settings) A scrollable area below the compass showing real-time location, weather, and more.
-   **Quick Actions Bar (FAB):** The floating buttons for quick access to True North, Calibration, and Theme toggles.

## Using the Level Screen

### 1. How does the redesigned Level Screen work?
The Level screen (v1.6.0+) is a powerful tool that uses expressive animations and adapts to how you hold your device.
-   **Flat Mode (Bullseye):** When your device is lying face-up on a surface, it shows a "bullseye" level. The goal is to center the morphing, fluid bubble.
-   **Linear Mode (Upright):** When your device is held upright (either vertically or horizontally), it shows a linear "bubble tube" level. The goal is to center the bubble on the `0°` mark. The UI intelligently adapts to portrait and landscape orientations.

### 2. How do I ensure the Level is accurate?
The Level tool uses the same motion sensors as the compass. For best results, place your phone on a known flat surface and use the **Calibrate** button on the main Compass screen. Performing the figure-eight motion will reset and improve the accuracy of all motion-based features.

## Pixel Compass on Wear OS

- **A Standalone Experience:** The Wear OS app is fully independent and uses your watch's own sensors.
- **Features:** It includes our signature Compass Rose, the Info Ring (Altitude, Incline, Lat/Lon), and a True North toggle.
- **Installation:** You can install it on your watch via your paired phone's Play Store app or directly from the Play Store on your watch.

## Pixel Compass+ & Widgets

### 1. What is Pixel Compass+?
Pixel Compass+ is our premium feature set, available via a flexible subscription or a lifetime license for early supporters. It unlocks the app's full potential and supports its future development.

### 2. What are the key Plus features?
-   **Deep Customization:** Unlock a powerful set of tools to change the look and feel of your compass and dynamic cards. Choose from exclusive compass styles (`Sunny`, `Cookie`, `Flower`), advanced card shapes (`Bubbly`, `Crystal`), and control details like cardinal points and degree marks.
-   **Advanced Dynamic Info Cards:** Get deeper insights with exclusive data cards like "Feels Like" temperature, Air Pressure, and a detailed Weather Condition description.
-   **Interactive Wind Indicator:** A toggleable wind direction arrow on the compass rose.
-   **All Home Screen Widgets:** A suite of powerful, configurable, and beautifully themed widgets for Altitude, Compass, Location, and 6 different Weather types.
-   **Ad-Free Experience:** Removes all advertising from the application.

### 3. How does the new Subscription work? What if I already paid?
We've moved to a flexible subscription model for new users to support ongoing development.
-   **New Users (v1.5.4+):** Pixel Compass+ is available via a low-cost monthly subscription.
-   **Legacy Users (You're a VIP!):** If you made the one-time purchase **before version 1.5.4**, you have **Pixel Compass+ Legacy status**. This means you get **free, lifetime access** to all premium features. Thank you for your early support!

### 4. How do I add and configure widgets?
1.  **Add:** Long-press your home screen, select "Widgets", and find Pixel Compass.
2.  **Configure:** After placing a widget, a configuration screen will open, allowing you to choose the data type for that widget (e.g., Altitude, Temperature, Wind).
3.  **Updates:** To save battery, widgets update periodically. For best results, grant "Allow all the time" location permission and disable battery restrictions for Pixel Compass.

## Compass Calibration – Ensuring Accuracy

### 1. When should I calibrate?
-   When the compass seems to be pointing in the wrong direction.
-   After first installing the app.
-   If you are near large metal objects or magnetic fields (e.g., in a car, near speakers).
-   If you've recently dropped your device.

### 2. How do I calibrate?
1.  On the main compass screen, tap the **Calibrate** button (`~` icon) in the floating action bar.
2.  A dialog will appear. While it's visible, move your device smoothly in a large **figure-eight (∞)** pattern.
3.  Rotate the device along all three of its axes. The dialog will close automatically after a few seconds.

## Troubleshooting & FAQ

-   **My compass is stuck or inaccurate.**
    -   First, try the calibration steps above. Ensure you are away from sources of magnetic interference. Also, check that your phone case does not contain magnets.

-   **What's the difference between True North and Magnetic North?**
    -   **Magnetic North:** The direction a physical compass needle points.
    -   **True North:** The direction to the geographic North Pole. This is the standard for most maps and requires location permission for best accuracy.

-   **My widgets are not updating.**
    -   Ensure the app has "Allow all the time" location permission and is exempted from battery optimization in your device settings. Opening the main app will force a refresh.

-   **Where does the app get its data from?**
    -   **Weather:** Google Weather API.
    -   **Elevation:** Google Elevation API, supplemented by your device's barometer and GPS.
    -   **Location Name:** Your device's native Geocoder service.

## Purchase, Subscription & Refunds

- **How do I manage my purchase or subscription?**
    - All purchases and subscriptions are managed securely through your **Google Play Store account**. You can view, cancel, or manage your subscription in the "Payments & subscriptions" section of the Play Store app.
- **How do I request a refund?**
    - **Within 48 hours:** You can request a refund directly through your Google Play order history.
    - **After 48 hours:** Please contact us at our support email with your Google Play Order ID (starts with "GPA.") and the reason for your request.
