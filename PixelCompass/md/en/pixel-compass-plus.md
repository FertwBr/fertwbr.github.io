## Licensing Model: Our Commitment to You

To ensure the continuous improvement and sustainable development of Pixel Compass, we offer two ways to access premium features. We deeply appreciate all our supporters, both early and new, and have structured our model to be fair and flexible.

### <md-icon>military_tech</md-icon> Pixel Compass+ Legacy (One-Time Purchase)

For users who prefer a single purchase, we offer a **lifetime license**. This option grants permanent access to all premium features available at the time of purchase, as well as future updates to those features.

Users who purchased the app **before version 1.7.2** (when the subscription was introduced) have been automatically upgraded to this lifetime license. Thank you for being a pioneer and believing in our project!

### <md-icon>new_releases</md-icon> Pixel Compass+ Subscription

For the most flexible access, Pixel Compass+ is available as a low-cost monthly subscription. This model ensures you receive **all current and future premium features** developed for the app. It's the best way to stay on the cutting edge and continuously support the project's evolution.

## Why a Subscription?

Adopting a subscription model is a decision we made to ensure the long-term health and innovation of Pixel Compass. Here’s why it benefits everyone:

| Reason | The Impact |
| :--- | :--- |
| <md-icon>update</md-icon> **Continuous Development** | A predictable revenue stream allows us to dedicate consistent development time to the app, meaning more frequent updates, new features, and bug fixes for you. |
| <md-icon>dns</md-icon> **Covers Ongoing Costs** | Features like high-precision altitude and real-time weather rely on third-party APIs (like Google Maps & Weather). These services have ongoing costs that a subscription model helps us cover sustainably. |
| <md-icon>support_agent</md-icon> **Dedicated Support** | A healthy development cycle means we can also afford to spend time providing quality user support and responding to feedback. |
| <md-icon>trending_up</md-icon> **Future-Proofing** | Subscriptions allow us to adapt to new Android versions, support new devices (like foldables and next-gen watches), and invest in more ambitious features down the road. |

By choosing to subscribe, you’re not just buying a product; you're investing in the continuous evolution of Pixel Compass. We believe this is the fairest way to build a high-quality tool that grows and improves with you.
