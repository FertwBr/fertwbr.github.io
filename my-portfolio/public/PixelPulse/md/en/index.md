## Privacy First {: data-toc-key="privacy" }

Your audio is your business. Pixel Pulse is designed with privacy as a core tenet.

* **On-Device Processing:** All sound analysis happens directly on your phone.
* **No Audio Recording:** When monitoring exposure, the app calculates the decibel level and immediately discards the raw audio data. No conversation or sound is ever saved to storage or sent to a server.
* **Transparent Permissions:** We only ask for the microphone permission when you are ready to measure.
