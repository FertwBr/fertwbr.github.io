# Roadmap & Vision

Explore the future of Pixel Compass. This document outlines our planned features, upcoming improvements, and the long-term vision for the ultimate navigation and weather companion.


## 🚀 Current Status: Version 1.15.0 Beta 1
We have recently unified the design language with Pixel Pulse, introducing responsive layouts for Plus screens and refining the overall UI consistency.


## 🛠️ Immediate Priorities (Next Updates)

### 📱 Phone
* **Smart Notifications:** Transform the simple persistent notification into a useful "Live Insight". Instead of just saying the app is running, it will display the current weather, future conditions, and the correct condition icon.
* **Altitude Calibration UX:** Refine the altitude calibration in 'Feet'. Remove redundant 'M' (meters) text when in imperial mode and ensure automatic conversion or a dedicated unit selector for manual calibration.
* **Master Switch Polish:** Invert the arrow and switch positions in the Master Switch for better ergonomic alignment.
* **Edge-to-Edge improvements:** Ensure full drawing under system bars across all main screens.

### ⌚ Wear OS
* **Altitude Complication:** A new complication type to show your current altitude directly on your favorite watch face.


## 📅 The Future (Planned Milestones)

### 💎 User Experience & Value
* **UI Tips & Discovery:** Implement a subtle guidance system to help users discover hidden features like long-press shortcuts and card flipping.
* **Enhanced Non-Plus Experience:** Improve the app's utility and layout for users who choose not to use Dynamic Cards.
* **Custom FAB:** Implement a highly customizable Floating Action Button.
* **Personalized Insights:** Deepen the Insight Engine to provide even more specific outdoor activity recommendations.

### 🎨 Deep Customization
* **Dynamic Cardinal Shapes:** The compass shape will subtly morph or change detail when pointing exactly to cardinal directions or True North.
* **Custom Dynamic Cards:** Allow users to create their own information grids, choosing exactly which metrics they want to see and in what order.
* **Scroll-to-More-Info:** A new interaction on the compass screen to reveal deeper environmental data through scrolling.

### ⚙️ Technical Evolution
* **Offline Mode:** Cache essential topographical data to allow for basic navigation and elevation features when no data connection is available.
* **16KB Page Size Support:** Optimize the app binary for future Android hardware standards (16kb page alignment).
* **Widget Expansion:** New widget types including a consolidated "Trip Overview" widget.


## 🐛 Known Issues to be Addressed
* **Customization Screen:** Fix the selection logic for the "Legacy" style in the customization menu.
* **Subscription States:** Fix regressions in screens related to expired subscriptions and first-time purchase flows.
* **Sensor Jitter:** Ongoing refinements to low-pass filters for even smoother needle movement on budget hardware.
